# icesat2
I'm a research meteorologist working at NASA on a project called ICESat-2. ICESat-2 is a satellite that uses laser pulses to measure very accurately the height of the erth's surface. It also measures properties of clouds and aerosols and that is the area I am involved with. Others on the team look at measurements of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets as well as glaciers and sea ice. Using these data they can determine how the ice and snow is changing (accumulating or melting).
